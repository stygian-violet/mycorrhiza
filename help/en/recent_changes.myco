= Recent changes
**Recent changes** is a special page that lists all latest changes on the wiki. There is a link to it by default in the [[{{root}}help/en/top_bar | top bar]]. You can also jump to it quickly by pressing the `g r` hotkey.

Engaged wiki editors usually visit this page quite often.

By default, it lists 20 recent changes. On the page, you can choose other number: 50 or 100.

The changes are grouped by date.

Each edit has these properties:
* **UTC time.**
* **Commit hash.** It functions as edit's id.
* **Editor,** if any.
* **Affected hyphae.** Most actions affect one hypha (such as actual editing), but some affect more (recursive editing, for example).
* **Message.** This message tells you what the edit is about. The message format is quite regular and parseable.
