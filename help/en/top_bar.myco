= Top bar
The **top bar** is present on every single page of the wiki. It is the primary navigation means.

On big screens, the top bar is spread onto two lines.
* First line
** Link to the [[{{root}} | home page]]
** Search bar
** //If authorization is enabled,//
*** Link to your profile, //if logged in//
*** //If not logged in,//
**** Login link
**** Register link
* Second line, most used links. These are the defaults:
** Recent changes
** All hyphae
** Random
** Help
** Categories

On small screens, the authorization section and the most-used-links section are hidden behind a menu. Click the button to see them. If your browser does not support JavaScript, they are always shown.

== Using the top bar
Wiki administrators are meant to configure the top bar links. Here is what you should put there:
* Popular articles
* Lists of something
* Recent changes
* Whatever you want, but not too much, of course. The space is limited

== Configuring the links
//This section is for administrators only.//

To change the default link, you first have to choose a hypha where you will store the configuration. A good choice would be to store as a subhypha of an administrator's profile hypha. In `config.ini`, in the `[Hyphae]` section set the hypha:
```ini
...
[Hyphae]
HeaderLinksHypha = u/admin/header_links
...
```

Reload the wiki.

Edit the hypha. You can put any markup there. Only rocket links will be used for generating the top bar:
