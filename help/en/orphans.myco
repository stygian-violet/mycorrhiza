= Orphaned hyphae
Page [[{{root}}orphans]] lists **orphaned hyphae**, or orphans for short. An orphan is a hypha with no backlinks, i/e not linked anywhere. Being part of a [[{{root}}help/en/category | category]] does not de-orphan the hypha.

This page can be used in some workflows. For example, you may create several hyphae, and get back to linking them later. Locating them in this list might help you.
