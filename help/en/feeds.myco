= Help: Feeds
Mycorrhiza Wiki has RSS, Atom, and JSON feeds to track the latest changes on the wiki.
These feeds are linked on the [[{{root}}recent-changes | recent changes page]].

== Options
These feeds have options to combine related changes into groups:
* {
    **period** Can be set to lengths of time like `5m`, `24h`, etc.
    Edits by the same author that happen within this time of each other can be grouped into one item in the feed.
}
* {
    **same** Can be set to `author`, `message`, or `none`.
    Edits will only be grouped together if they have the same author or message. By default, edits need to have the same author and message. If it is `none`, all edits can be grouped.
}
* {
    **order** Can be set to `old-to-now` (default) or `new-to-old`.
    This determines what order edits in groups will be shown in in your feed.
}

If none of these options are set, changes will never be grouped.

== Examples
URLs for feeds using these options look like this:
* {
    `{{root}}recent-changes-rss?period=1h`
    Changes within one hour of each other with the same author and message will be grouped together.
}
* {
    `{{root}}recent-changes-atom?period=1h&order=new-to-old`
    Same as the last one, but the groups will be shown in the opposite order.
}
* {
    `{{root}}recent-changes-atom?period=1h&same=none`
    Changes within one hour of each other will be grouped together, even with different authors and messages.
}
* {
    `{{root}}recent-changes-atom?same=author&same=message`
    Changes with the same author and message will be grouped together no matter how much time passes between them.
}
