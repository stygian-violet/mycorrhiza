= Interwiki
**Interwiki** is a means of bringing wikis together, making a federation of them. In Mycorrhiza, one aspect of interwiki is supported: the interwiki links, or the **interlinks**. Most other wiki systems support them too. Interwiki links are shown in green.

In Mycomarkup, you can address a different wiki by prefixing the link target with a name and a `>` character. For example:
```myco
[[Wikipedia>Wiki]]
=> Mycorrhiza>deployment
```

The interwiki prefixes obey the same naming rules as hyphae. In particular, they are case-insensitive, among other things. Every interwiki entry has one main name and it might have any number of aliases, which can be used interchangeably.

See [[{{root}}interwiki]] for the list of configured interwiki entries. Unlike the WWW, there is no distributed list of wikis similar to DNS, so each wiki administrator has to maintain their own list.

== Mycorrhiza interwiki
Intermycorrhizal interwiki works the best, due to the nature of hyphae. Unlike with some other systems, you can address images from the other wikis reliably.

```myco
img {
   melanocarpa>quadrat 12
}
```

== Setting the intermap
//This section is meant for wiki administrators.//
**Intermap**, or interwiki map, is the collection of all configured interwiki entries. To configure it, an administrator has to visit [[{{root}}interwiki]] and change the existing entries or add a new one.

Entries have the following fields:
*. {
   **Name.** This is the canonical name of the wiki and one of the prefixes you can use for interlinks.
}
*. {
   **Aliases.** They are separated with commas. You don't have to set them up.

   A good idea is to have the full name in the //name// field (such as `wikipedia`), and shorter names in //aliases// (such as `pedia` and `wp`).
}
*. {
   **URL.** The URL of the index/home/main page of the wiki. It should not end on trailing slash.
}
*. {
   **Engine.** This is the software the target wiki runs.

   There are two engines supported explicitly:
   * Mycorrhiza
   * [[https://anagora.org | Agora]]

   Choose the //Generic// option for sites running different software.
}
*. {
   **Formats.** Because interlinks are supported for two cases (hyperlinks and images), there has to be a way to convert a resource name to an URL of the resource. Format strings are a way to do that.

   There are two format strings: one for hyperlinks, one for images. They directly correspond to HTML's `href` and `src` attributes of the `a` and `img` tags.

   For Mycorrhiza wikis, you don't have to set them, they are set automatically to the following values (replace `https\:/\/example.org` with the URL of the target wiki):
   * Link: `https\:/\/example.org/hypha/{NAME}`
   * Image: `https\:/\/example.org/binary/{NAME}`

   For Agora, they are set to:
   * Link: `https\:/\/example.org/node/{NAME}`
   * Image: `https\:/\/example.org/{NAME}`, which doesn't make a lot of sense

   For generic sites, you will have to think of something by yourself. If you do not set it, it will default to `https\:/\/example.org/{NAME}`.

   `{NAME}` is substituted. For example, from link `[\[Melanocarpa\>uxn]]`, `{NAME}` is replaced with `uxn`.
}

You can also change `interwiki.json` directly. Reload the wiki after editing it.
